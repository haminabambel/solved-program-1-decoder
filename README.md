Write a program titled”YourLastName_Decoder”that decodes a secret message contained in a text file.



The first line of the text file contains the key-phrase. Then the file contains a sequence of integers, each of which indexes the key-phrase. Find the character corresponding to each integer and output the secret message.Note if a character such as ‘e’ occurs several places in the key-phrase it may be encoded as different integers in different parts of the secret message.

For example, here is the contents of a secret message file ready for the program:The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog 36 0 31 36 7 8 25 31 1 33 19 10 11 6 40 42 2 3 36 0 39 40 36 13 14
